Description: The switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) diversity panel
    is now being grown at many locations across the United States and
    Mexico. Many researchers are measuring phenotypes on this panel to
    understand the genes and genetic regions affecting these phenotypes.
    This package provides the code for fast, less memory intensive genome- 
    wide association (GWAS) using bigsnpr. It also provides functions to link 
    diversity panel phenotypic data with SNP data, to prepare basic plots
    for further customization, and to prepare multiple GWAS results for
    use in the downstream application mash.
